Kitsune-enabled Vsftpd
======================

This is a version of the Very Secure FTP Server patched to support
dynamic updating using Kitsune.

The versions in the vsftpd directory have manually-written state
transformer code in dsu.c. Versions in the vsftpd-gen directory use
Kitsune's `xfgen` tool to automatically generate a dsu.c based on the
directives in vsftpd.xf.

Building
========

To build all versions, simply run `make` in either the vsftpd or
vsftpd-gen directory. To build a specific version, run `make` in its
subdirectory.

If Kitsune is not installed in your PATH, the variable KITSUNE_PATH
must refer to a valid Kitsune installation (the `bin` directory of the
core Kitsune repository will work).

vsftpd's build dependencies are libpam, libssl, and libwrap. Build
dependencies can be easily installed on Debian-derived systems by
running `apt-get build-dep vsfptd`.

Running
=======

Use the Kitsune driver utility to run the vsftpd shared object as such:

`driver vsftpd.so vsftpd.conf`

Updating
========

To update vsftpd, use Kitsune's `doupd` script:

`doupd <vsftpd pid> <new tor version.so>`

For a dynamic update to work, the target version must have been built
with the running version specified as its previous version. All
versions of vsftpd are, by default, built to update from the last
available version.
